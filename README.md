Pre-requisites: 

1. Install ESBMC and make sure that it is working on the chosen machine properly - preferably on a Linux Operating System (OS), (Other OS may work but setting up may be a bit more challenging).
   
2. Install Vampire Automated Theorem Prover and ensure that runs properly on the system.

3. Ensure that you have an OpenAI API Key - that will allow you run the Script with the GPT Model (LLM).
